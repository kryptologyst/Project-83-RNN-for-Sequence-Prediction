# Project 83: RNN for Sequence Prediction

## Description

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network designed for sequential data such as time series, language, or sensor readings. In this project, we build a basic LSTM network using Keras to predict the next value in a numerical sequence based on past observations.

This project demonstrates:
- Implementation of an LSTM for predicting sequential values.
- Preparation of sliding window sequences from a time series.
- Training and visualization of predictions vs. actual values.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 0083_RNN_for_sequence_prediction
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python lstm_sequence_prediction.py
```

This will train the LSTM model and print the Mean Squared Error to the console.
